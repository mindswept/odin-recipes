# odin-recipes

For this project, I will be building a basic recipe website.

The skills demonstrated during this project:

- Utilization of headings (h1-h6).

- Use of anchor tags to specify the relative paths for recipe html pages used for
  the Odin Recipes project.

- Creating lists: both unordered and ordered.

- Placing images for recipes by utilizing relative path to the directory that
  stores recipes images.
